## Learn Rust with Examples

This is a simple and fast way to learn rust with examples , This will be pretty easy if you had some background information in programming unless to understand this you'll need to learn basics of programming all you will need to go on official docs of [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to get started

### Source
This docs originally came from [rust by examples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) the step by step examples which officially made by rust team, so i made this while i was studying rust and made the repo so that it can help other developers to learn rust so fast the same way i did
